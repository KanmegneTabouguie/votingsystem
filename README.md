Voting System Blockchain
This is a simple implementation of a voting system using a blockchain. The system includes functionality for managing candidates, voters, and conducting elections.

Blockchain
Block Structure
A block in the blockchain consists of the following components:

Index: The block's position in the blockchain.
Timestamp: The time when the block was added to the blockchain.
Transactions: A list of transactions included in the block.
Proof: The proof of work number that validates the block.
PreviousHash: The hash of the previous block in the blockchain.
Proof of Work
The proof-of-work algorithm is implemented to secure the blockchain. It involves finding a specific nonce value that, when hashed with the block data, meets a certain difficulty level.

Blockchain Operations
Adding Blocks: New blocks are added to the blockchain using the AddBlock method. Each block contains a list of transactions, and the proof of work is calculated during block addition.

Validating Blockchain: The IsValid method checks the integrity and validity of the blockchain. It verifies that each block's previous hash matches and that the proof of work is valid.

Counting Votes: The CountVotes method tallies the votes for a specific candidate by examining the transactions in the blockchain.

Candidates
Candidates are represented by the Candidate struct. Each candidate has an ID, a name, and a description.

Voters
Voters are represented by the Voter struct. Each voter has an ID, a name, and a flag indicating whether they have voted.

Usage
The main program demonstrates the functionality of the voting system. It initializes the blockchain, candidate list, and voter list. It then simulates the voting process, adds blocks to the blockchain for each vote, and displays election results.

Running the Program
To run the program, execute the main package. Follow the prompts to enter candidate names, voter names, and simulate the voting process.

Note: This implementation is for educational purposes and may require additional security measures for production use. Ensure proper authentication and authorization mechanisms are implemented before deploying in a production environment.
